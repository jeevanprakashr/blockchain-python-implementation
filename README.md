# Python Implementation of Blockchain

Note: This project is done and can be referred only for learning purposes and it is not a production ready project.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

## How to execute

- Open up terminal inside the project folder and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Then you can run the code by executing `python node.py` which will start up the blockchain server in the `default` localhost address which is `localhost:5000`.
- Open up a browser and visit the same address to view the client UI.
- You can also simulate adding multiple nodes and forming a network by executing the same code with different ports by executing the following commands: `python node.py -p 5001` or `python node.py --port 5001`.
